- Salamander, antlers, hermaphroditism, cat eyes, colored zebra striped, gas processing gills for "heavier than air" pools, like spiked whips and dagger, pull enemies into the gas pools.
- magic "duel" would be a series of movements/button presses, like a dance, where one person would be trying to overpower the other, want a bit of runaway victory after a short period of "posturing"
- During duel player actual movement would be very limited due to needinging to focus on the duel but they do still have adgency.
- magically locking a door does not prevent it from being busted down or someone magically unlocking. Duel would initiate only if someone was focusing on maintaining the lock. Again this would not prevent the door from being broken down, but wpuld prevent it from just being opened.
- during dual movement is not restricted but the more mivement being done reduces the size of the bad/good/great/perfect key hit scores. Dual still series of button pressed but who wins/ lises is mostly up to who matches the button presses better. Every once and a while can get an "overwhelm" attempt where you get to "send" a burst of button presses to them

- rythum based combat where as rythum speeds up "power" of attacks goes down. Good to keep rythm down to keep hit damage/power up, but may need to speed up to parry,counter, or make an opening for ally.
- to keep range from being op, ppl have "magic" projectile shields/defenses, either .aintained themselves or by others. Must disrupt that shield for ranged shots to land properly. Shield only caueses projectiles to change their trajectory slightly. Bigger projectile more energy cost to the use to deflect. Shild caster/user can set "mass" limit for objects that the shield should auto block. Forces people to get in close to disrupt shield

- wild magic vs tame magic. Wild magic spells allow the user to specify the amount of energy they are willing to spend, or tells them how much it will take.  Take magic are basically wild magic with a limit for energy preset, for some abilities there will be additional options as well, such as the projectile shields having a projectile mad setting.

- Parallel worlds style processing. As much of the physics and "time" dependent processing done on the server and AI is used in an attempt to predict what the player will do in time sensitive situations and do the physics simulation of that event in advance. This would help with the may generals problem as well where building up a profile of individual players on the server and their habits would facilitate an understanding of what they will most likely do in a situation and all the game world to respond better in general.
- player data for prediction encrypted by account id and code generated on client side for that specific server/word stored on the client

- fly swatter/tennis racket like weapon. Small wire blades on the inside to kill insect/ small drove enemies
- talking to villagers can also unlock specific powers/items

Capstone
- Gems/Gear earned through token drops from more difficult enemies.
- "Leaf" enemies keep spawning from their parent tree until the parent tree is killed. Parent tree roots will suck power from NPCs/players until it is destroyed. Parent tree has an absorb phase, a spawn phase, and a physical attack phase
- Sharp weapons dull, which can be sharpened at the blacksmith, high damage when sharp, and lower damage when dull. Blunt weapons do constant damage; roughly 50% of the sharp weapons damage curve between their dull and sharpened state.
